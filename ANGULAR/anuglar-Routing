Sure, let's dive into Angular routing both deeply and simplistically.

### Simplified Explanation:

Angular routing allows you to navigate between different components in your Angular application without reloading the entire page. It's like moving between pages in a traditional web application, but without the page refresh.

1. **Setting up Routes**: You define routes in the Angular application using the RouterModule provided by `@angular/router` module. Routes are configured in the `app-routing.module.ts` file.

2. **Route Configuration**: Each route is defined with a path and a component. When a URL matches a defined path, Angular loads the associated component.

3. **Router Outlet**: In your main application layout (usually `app.component.html`), you place a `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` element. This serves as a placeholder where Angular dynamically loads the component corresponding to the current route.

4. **Navigation**: You can navigate between routes using the `routerLink` directive in your templates or programmatically using the Router service.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **RouterModule and AppRoutingModule**:

   - Angular's routing functionality is provided by the `RouterModule` from `@angular/router`.
   - In most Angular projects, routes are configured in a separate module called `AppRoutingModule`.
   - You import `RouterModule.forRoot(routes)` in `AppRoutingModule`, where `routes` is an array defining your application routes.

2. **Route Configuration**:

   - Each route is defined as an object in the `routes` array.
   - A route object typically consists of:
     - `path`: The URL path that triggers the route.
     - `component`: The component to load when the route is activated.
     - Optionally, you can define additional properties like `redirectTo` or `children` for nested routes.

3. **Router Outlet**:

   - In your main application layout (usually `app.component.html`), you place a `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` element.
   - This element serves as a placeholder where Angular dynamically loads the component associated with the current route.

4. **Navigation**:

   - You can navigate between routes using:
     - `routerLink` directive: In your HTML templates, you use `routerLink` attribute to specify the route path.
     - Router service: In your TypeScript code, you use the Router service to navigate imperatively. For example, `router.navigate(['/path'])`.

5. **Route Parameters**:

   - Routes can have parameters that allow you to pass data in the URL. For example, `/users/:id` where `:id` is a route parameter.
   - You can access route parameters using ActivatedRoute service in the component associated with the route.

6. **Child Routes**:

   - You can define child routes to create nested navigation structures. Child routes are configured within parent route objects.
   - Child routes are useful for organizing and modularizing your application.

7. **Route Guards**:
   - Angular provides route guards to control access to routes based on certain conditions.
   - Route guards can be used to prevent unauthorized access, perform authentication, or perform other tasks before activating a route.

By understanding and utilizing Angular routing effectively, you can create powerful and dynamic single-page applications with smooth navigation between different views.

### Example

Let's dive deeper into each part of the code example provided.

### Step 1: Define Routes in AppRoutingModule

```typescript
// app-routing.module.ts

import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { Routes, RouterModule } from "@angular/router";
import { HomeComponent } from "./home.component";
import { UserDetailsComponent } from "./user-details.component";

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: "", component: HomeComponent },
  { path: "user/:id", component: UserDetailsComponent },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule],
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

Explanation:

1. **Import Statements**:

   - We import NgModule from `@angular/core` for Angular module functionality.
   - We import Routes and RouterModule from `@angular/router` for defining routes and configuring Angular router.

2. **Routes Configuration**:

   - We define routes using the Routes array.
   - `{ path: '', component: HomeComponent }`: This route maps the empty path (`'/'`) to the HomeComponent.
   - `{ path: 'user/:id', component: UserDetailsComponent }`: This route maps the path `/user/:id` to the UserDetailsComponent. `:id` is a route parameter representing the user ID.

3. **NgModule Decorator**:
   - We use `@NgModule` decorator to define the AppRoutingModule as an Angular module.
   - We specify `imports` as `[RouterModule.forRoot(routes)]` to configure the router with our defined routes.
   - We specify `exports` as `[RouterModule]` to make the RouterModule directives (like `routerLink`) available to other modules in the application.

### Step 2: Create HomeComponent

```typescript
// home.component.ts

import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { Router } from "@angular/router";

@Component({
  selector: "app-home",
  template: `
    <h1>Welcome to Home</h1>
    <button (click)="goToUserDetails(1)">View User Details</button>
  `,
})
export class HomeComponent {
  constructor(private router: Router) {}

  goToUserDetails(userId: number) {
    this.router.navigate(["/user", userId]);
  }
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Import Statements**:

   - We import Component from `@angular/core` for Angular component functionality.
   - We import Router from `@angular/router` to perform navigation between routes.

2. **Component Decorator**:

   - We decorate the HomeComponent class with `@Component` decorator to define it as an Angular component.
   - We specify `selector` as `'app-home'` for using this component in HTML templates.
   - We define the component template inline using the `template` property.

3. **Router Navigation**:
   - We inject Router service in the constructor to perform navigation.
   - `goToUserDetails(userId: number)`: This method navigates to UserDetailsComponent with a user ID as a route parameter using `router.navigate(['/user', userId])`.

### Step 3: Create UserDetailsComponent

```typescript
// user-details.component.ts

import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { ActivatedRoute } from "@angular/router";

@Component({
  selector: "app-user-details",
  template: `
    <h1>User Details</h1>
    <p>User ID: {{ userId }}</p>
  `,
})
export class UserDetailsComponent implements OnInit {
  userId: number;

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.userId = +this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get("id");
  }
}
```

Explanation:

1. **Import Statements**:

   - We import Component and OnInit from `@angular/core`.
   - We import ActivatedRoute from `@angular/router` to access route parameters.

2. **Component Decorator**:

   - We decorate the UserDetailsComponent class with `@Component` decorator to define it as an Angular component.
   - We specify `selector` as `'app-user-details'` for using this component in HTML templates.
   - We define the component template inline using the `template` property.

3. **Accessing Route Parameters**:
   - We inject ActivatedRoute service in the constructor to access route parameters.
   - In `ngOnInit()` lifecycle hook, we use `route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id')` to retrieve the user ID from the route parameters.

### Step 4: Import AppRoutingModule in AppModule

```typescript
// app.module.ts

import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
import { AppRoutingModule } from "./app-routing.module";
import { HomeComponent } from "./home.component";
import { UserDetailsComponent } from "./user-details.component";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [HomeComponent, UserDetailsComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, AppRoutingModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [HomeComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Explanation:

1. **Import Statements**:

   - We import NgModule from `@angular/core` for Angular module functionality.
   - We import BrowserModule from `@angular/platform-browser` for browser-specific rendering.
   - We import AppRoutingModule from `./app-routing.module` to configure routing in the application.
   - We import HomeComponent and UserDetailsComponent for declaring them as part of the module.

2. **NgModule Decorator**:
   - We decorate the AppModule class with `@NgModule` decorator to define it as an Angular module.
   - We specify `declarations` to declare the components that belong to the module.
   - We specify `imports` to import other modules required by the module. Here, we import BrowserModule and AppRoutingModule.
   - We specify `bootstrap` as `[HomeComponent]` to define the root component of the application.

### Summary:

- We defined routes in AppRoutingModule using RouterModule and Routes array.
- HomeComponent navigates to UserDetailsComponent passing a user ID as a route parameter using Router service.
- UserDetailsComponent extracts the user ID from route parameters using ActivatedRoute service.
- AppModule imports AppRoutingModule to make our routes available throughout the application.

By following these steps, we've created a simple Angular application with routing, route parameters, and navigation between routes. This example demonstrates how to use route parameters, ActivatedRoute, and Router service in Angular routing.
