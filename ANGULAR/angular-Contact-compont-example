Let's break down the provided Angular code for the ContactsComponent step by step:

### Imports:
```typescript
import { Component, OnInit, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { Title } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';
import { ToastrService } from 'ngx-toastr';
import { AppComponent } from 'src/app/app.component';
import { ApiService } from 'src/app/core/services/api.service';
import { AuthenticationService } from 'src/app/core/services/auth.service';
import { environment } from 'src/environments/environment';
import { Location } from "./location";
```
Explanation:
- We import necessary Angular modules and services like Component, OnInit, ViewChild, Title, Router, etc.
- We import third-party libraries like ToastrService for displaying notifications and Location for managing location data.
- We import custom services like ApiService and AuthenticationService.
- We also import environment variables for managing different environment configurations.

### Component Definition:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-contacts',
  templateUrl: './contacts.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./contacts.component.scss']
})
```
Explanation:
- We define the ContactsComponent with a selector 'app-contacts'.
- We specify the template and style files for the component.

### Class Declaration and Initialization:
```typescript
export class ContactsComponent implements OnInit {
  // Component properties
}
```
Explanation:
- We declare the ContactsComponent class and implement the OnInit lifecycle hook.
- We define various properties like myLocation, stateList, cityList, dataTable, etc., to manage component data and state.

### Constructor and ngOnInit():
```typescript
constructor(
  private api: ApiService,
  private toast: ToastrService,
  public authS: AuthenticationService,
  public router: Router,
  public title: Title,
  public appC: AppComponent
) {}

ngOnInit(): void {
  // Component initialization logic
}
```
Explanation:
- We inject ApiService, ToastrService, AuthenticationService, Router, Title, and AppComponent into the constructor for accessing services and functionalities.
- We initialize the component in the ngOnInit lifecycle hook, setting up initial data and fetching necessary resources.

### Component Methods:
```typescript
edit(i: any) { /* Method implementation */ }

private _fetchData() { /* Method implementation */ }

clearFilter() { /* Method implementation */ }

submit() { /* Method implementation */ }

delete(i: any) { /* Method implementation */ }
```
Explanation:
- We define various component methods like edit(), _fetchData(), clearFilter(), submit(), and delete () to handle different functionalities such as editing, fetching data, clearing filters, submitting form data, and deleting contacts.

### Additional Component Properties:
```typescript
// Additional properties
```
Explanation:
- We define additional properties like loader, searchTerm, name, mobile, address, area, etc., to manage component state and form data.

### Component HTML Template:
```html
<app-breadcrumb [items]="breadCrumbItems"></app-breadcrumb>
<!-- HTML template code -->
```
Explanation:
- We define the HTML template for the ContactsComponent, including Angular directives like app - breadcrumb for displaying breadcrumb navigation.
- We bind component properties and methods to the template for dynamic rendering and user interaction.

This breakdown explains each part of the provided Angular code for the ContactsComponent, including imports, component definition, class declaration, lifecycle hooks, methods, properties, and HTML template.







    Let's break down the provided code snippet step by step:

### 1. `getCities(event:any)` method:
```typescript
getCities(event: any) {
  let area = this.areas.filter((res: any) => res.name == event)[0]._id;
  this.api.getAllCity({ area: area }).subscribe(data => {
    this.cities = data.data
  });
}
```
Explanation:
- This method is triggered when a selection event occurs, typically associated with a dropdown or selection input for areas.
- It filters the`this.areas` array based on the selected area's name and retrieves the `_id` of the matching area.
    - It then calls `api.getAllCity()` with the selected area's `_id` to fetch the cities associated with that area.
        - Once the data is received from the API, it updates the `this.cities` array with the fetched city data.

### 2. `getStates(event:any)` method:
```typescript
getStates(event: any) {
  let city = this.cities.filter((res: any) => res.name == event)[0]._id;
  this.api.getAllState({ city: city }).subscribe(data => {
    this.states = data.data
  });
}
```
Explanation:
- This method is triggered when a selection event occurs, typically associated with a dropdown or selection input for cities.
- It filters the`this.cities` array based on the selected city's name and retrieves the `_id` of the matching city.
    - It then calls `api.getAllState()` with the selected city's `_id` to fetch the states associated with that city.
        - Once the data is received from the API, it updates the `this.states` array with the fetched state data.

### 3. `edit(i:any)` method:
```typescript
edit(i: any) {
  this.create = true;
  this.editS = true;
  this.name = this.data[i].name;
  this.address = this.data[i].address;
  this.mobile = this.data[i].mobile;
  this.area = this.data[i].area;
  this.city = this.data[i].city;
  this.district = this.data[i].district;
  this.state = this.data[i].state;
  this.pin = this.data[i].pin;
  this.contactId = this.data[i]._id;
}
```
Explanation:
- This method is called when an edit action is initiated, usually when editing a contact.
- It sets flags `create` and `editS` to true to indicate that the editing mode is active.
- It retrieves the details of the contact to be edited from the `this.data` array based on the provided index`i`.
- It assigns the retrieved contact details to respective properties for editing.
- It also sets the `contactId` property to the `_id` of the contact being edited.

### 4. `private _fetchData()` method:
```typescript
private _fetchData() {
  this.data = [];
  const fdata = JSON.stringify({
    "condition": {}
  });
  this.api.getAllContacts(fdata).subscribe(data => {
    this.data = data.data;
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.dataTable = $(this.table.nativeElement);
      this.dataTable.DataTable({
        "searching": false,
        "lengthChange": false,
        "info": false
      });
    }, 500);
  }, error => {
    this.toast.error(error.message);
    this.loader = false;
  });
}
```
Explanation:
- This method is responsible for fetching data, typically contacts, from the API.
- It clears the `this.data` array to ensure a fresh data fetch.
- It constructs a JSON object `fdata` to specify any conditions for data retrieval(usually empty in this case).
- It calls the API service method `api.getAllContacts()` with the constructed data object.
- Upon receiving the data from the API, it updates the `this.data` array with the fetched contact data.
- It initializes a DataTable component using jQuery to render the data table with specific options like disabling search, length change, and info display.
- It also handles any errors that occur during the data fetch, displaying an error toast message and updating the `loader` flag accordingly.

These methods are essential parts of managing contacts in an Angular application, handling data fetching, filtering, editing, and rendering.
