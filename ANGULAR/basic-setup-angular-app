##Angualr Setups For Project

Installtion For Anguler Gudies

Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to installing Angular:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:

   - Angular requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to be installed on your system. You can download and install them from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Install Angular CLI**:

   - Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications. You can install it globally using npm. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
     ```
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```

3. **Create a New Angular Project**:

   - Once Angular CLI is installed, you can use it to create a new Angular project. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project and run:
     ```
     ng new my-angular-app
     ```
     Replace `my-angular-app` with your preferred project name.

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   - After creating the project, navigate into the project directory:
     ```
     cd my-angular-app
     ```

5. **Run the Application**:

   - Now that you're inside the project directory, you can run your Angular application using the Angular CLI's `serve` command. This command compiles the application and starts a development server. Run:
     ```
     ng serve
     ```
     Your Angular application will be served at `http://localhost:4200/` by default.

6. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. You should see your Angular application running.

That's it! You have successfully installed Angular and created a new Angular project. You can start building your application by modifying the files in the project directory. Refer to the [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/docs) for more detailed information on how to develop Angular applications.

##### Any Specif Version Downloaded Angular

Certainly! If you want to install a specific version of Angular, you can specify the version when creating a new Angular project using Angular CLI.

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install Angular CLI** (if you haven't already):

   ```
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

2. **Create a New Angular Project with a Specific Version**:
   You can specify the version of Angular while creating a new project using Angular CLI. For example, if you want to create a project with Angular version 12, you can run:

   ```
   ng new my-angular-app --strict --version 12
   ```

   Replace `my-angular-app` with your preferred project name.

   The `--strict` flag enables strict mode, which helps catch common errors early in the development process.

   If you don't specify a version, Angular CLI will install the latest stable version by default.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```
   cd my-angular-app
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```
   ng serve
   ```

By following these steps, you'll create a new Angular project with the specified version and can start working on it as usual.
