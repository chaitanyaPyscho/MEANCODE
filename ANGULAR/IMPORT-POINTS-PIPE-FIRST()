### PIPE FIRST() METHOD

Certainly! Let's break down the use of `pipe(first())` with an example:

Suppose you have an observable that emits a sequence of numbers asynchronously, but you're only interested in the first emitted number. You can use `pipe(first())` to ensure that you only receive the first emitted value and then complete the observable stream. Here's how you can achieve this:

```typescript
import { of } from "rxjs";
import { first } from "rxjs/operators";

// Create an observable that emits numbers asynchronously
const numbersObservable = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

// Apply the first operator using pipe
numbersObservable.pipe(first()).subscribe(
  (value) => {
    console.log("First value emitted:", value);
  },
  (error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  },
  () => {
    console.log("Observable completed after the first value.");
  }
);
```

In this example:

1. We import the `of` function from RxJS to create an observable that emits a sequence of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

2. We import the `first` operator from RxJS operators.

3. We apply the `first` operator to the `numbersObservable` using `pipe(first())`. This ensures that only the first emitted value will be processed, and then the observable will complete.

4. We subscribe to the modified observable. In the subscription, we provide three callback functions: one to handle emitted values, one to handle errors, and one to handle the completion of the observable.

5. When the observable emits its first value, it logs "First value emitted: [value]" to the console.

6. If there's an error during emission, it logs the error.

7. After emitting the first value, the observable completes, and it logs "Observable completed after the first value." to the console.

This example demonstrates how `pipe(first())` ensures that you only receive the first emitted value from the observable and then complete the observable stream.

### OUTPUT

Certainly! Here's the output you would get when running the provided example:

```
First value emitted: 1
Observable completed after the first value.
```

Explanation:

- The observable emits the first value, which is 1.
- The subscription's next handler logs "First value emitted: 1" to the console.
- As soon as the first value is emitted, the observable completes.
- The completion handler logs "Observable completed after the first value." to the console.

This demonstrates that `pipe(first())` ensures that only the first emitted value is processed, and then the observable completes, as expected.
