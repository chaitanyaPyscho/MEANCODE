Creating an industry-level MongoDB schema involves designing a structure that efficiently organizes and manages your data. Here's a guide to creating a robust MongoDB schema:

Understand Requirements: Begin by understanding the data requirements of your application. Consider the types of data you'll be storing, the relationships between them, and the anticipated usage patterns.

Normalize or Embed: Decide whether to normalize your data (using references between collections) or embed documents within one another. This choice depends on factors like data size, data access patterns, and the need for transactional integrity.

Use Embedded Documents for 1-to-1 and 1-to-N Relationships: If your data exhibits a 1-to-1 or 1-to-N relationship, consider embedding documents within one another. This approach reduces the need for joins and can improve query performance.

Use References for N-to-M Relationships: For many-to-many relationships, use references between collections. This allows for more flexible querying and avoids data duplication.

Optimize Query Performance: Design your schema to optimize query performance. This may involve denormalizing data or creating indexes on fields commonly used in queries.

Consider Data Growth: Anticipate how your data will grow over time and design your schema to accommodate this growth. This may involve sharding or partitioning data across multiple servers.

Ensure Data Consistency: Ensure data consistency by using transactions (if supported by your MongoDB version) or by carefully designing your schema to handle edge cases and failures.

Handle Relationships Carefully: When designing schemas with relationships, consider the cardinality of the relationship and how it will affect query performance and data access patterns.

Validate Data: Implement data validation at the application level to ensure that only valid data is inserted into the database. MongoDB provides features like schema validation and document validation to enforce data integrity.

Schema Versioning: Plan for schema versioning to handle changes to your data model over time. This may involve using migration scripts or tools to update existing data to match the new schema.
