To write industry-level code in a MEAN stack application (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js), including folder structure and tips, follow these guidelines:

Folder Structure:
Root Directory:

package.json: Dependency management file.
server.js or app.js: Entry point for the Node.js server.
Backend (Node.js/Express):

src/ or server/:
config/: Configuration files (database connection, environment variables, etc.).
controllers/: Business logic.
middlewares/: Custom middleware functions.
models/: Database models (Mongoose schemas).
routes/: Route definitions.
services/: Additional services (authentication, email, etc.).
utils/: Utility functions.
app.js: Express application setup.
server.js: Server initialization.
Frontend (Angular):

public/ or client/:
app/: Angular application components, modules, services, etc.
components/: Reusable UI components.
services/: Angular services for data manipulation.
views/: Angular views or pages.
assets/: Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
app.module.ts: Angular application module.
app-routing.module.ts: Angular routing module.
angular.json: Angular CLI configuration.
tsconfig.json: TypeScript configuration.
index.html: Main HTML file.
main.ts: Entry point for Angular application.
styles.css: Global styles.
Database (MongoDB):

No specific folder required. MongoDB is typically managed separately, either locally or using a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
Tips for Writing Industry-Level Code:
Follow Best Practices:

Adhere to coding standards and best practices for each technology in the stack.
Follow style guides (e.g., Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, Angular Style Guide).
Use linters and formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) to maintain code consistency.
Modularize Code:

Organize code into reusable modules, components, and services.
Encapsulate functionality to improve maintainability and scalability.
Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling mechanisms in both frontend and backend.
Use try-catch blocks, error middleware, and global error handlers.
Security:

Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Use HTTPS for secure communication.
Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities.
Testing:

Write unit tests for backend and frontend code using frameworks like Mocha, Chai, Jasmine, and Karma.
Perform integration testing to ensure different components work together seamlessly.
Use tools like Postman or Insomnia for API testing.
Documentation:

Document code using comments, especially for complex logic or business rules.
Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.
Version Control:

Use Git for version control.
Follow branching strategies (e.g., GitFlow) and commit conventions.
Performance Optimization:

Optimize frontend performance by minimizing HTTP requests, lazy loading modules, and using efficient data binding techniques.
Backend performance can be improved by optimizing database queries, caching, and using asynchronous programming.
Scalability:

Design the application with scalability in mind.
Use horizontal scaling techniques (e.g., load balancing) to handle increased traffic.
Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):

Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment.
Use tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.
Monitor application performance and health using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic.
