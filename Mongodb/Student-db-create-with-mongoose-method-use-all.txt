Sure, let's create a Mongoose schema for a `Student` collection with the specified fields, including arrays and objects, and perform basic CRUD operations using Mongoose methods.

First, let's define the Mongoose schema:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

// Define Student Schema
const studentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    lastname: String,
    email: String,
    password: String,
    address: {
        street: String,
        city: String,
        country: String
    },
    paccard: [String] // Array of strings (for multiple pac cards)
});

// Create Student model
const Student = mongoose.model('Student', studentSchema);

module.exports = Student;
```

Now, let's perform CRUD operations using Mongoose methods:

1. **Create a new student**:

   ```javascript
   const Student = require('./studentModel');

   const newStudent = new Student({
       name: 'John',
       lastname: 'Doe',
       email: 'john.doe@example.com',
       password: 'password123',
       address: {
           street: '123 Main St',
           city: 'New York',
           country: 'USA'
       },
       paccard: ['123456', '789012']
   });

   newStudent.save()
       .then(student => {
           console.log('New student created:', student);
       })
       .catch(err => {
           console.error('Error creating student:', err);
       });
   ```

2. **Find a student by email**:

   ```javascript
   Student.findOne({ email: 'john.doe@example.com' })
       .then(student => {
           console.log('Found student by email:', student);
       })
       .catch(err => {
           console.error('Error finding student:', err);
       });
   ```

3. **Update a student's address**:

   ```javascript
   Student.findOneAndUpdate(
       { email: 'john.doe@example.com' },
       { address: { street: '456 Oak St', city: 'Los Angeles', country: 'USA' } },
       { new: true }
   )
   .then(updatedStudent => {
       console.log('Updated student address:', updatedStudent);
   })
   .catch(err => {
       console.error('Error updating student address:', err);
   });
   ```

4. **Add a new pac card to a student's record**:

   ```javascript
   Student.findOneAndUpdate(
       { email: 'john.doe@example.com' },
       { $push: { paccard: '345678' } },
       { new: true }
   )
   .then(updatedStudent => {
       console.log('Updated student with new pac card:', updatedStudent);
   })
   .catch(err => {
       console.error('Error updating student pac card:', err);
   });
   ```

5. **Delete a student by email**:

   ```javascript
   Student.findOneAndDelete({ email: 'john.doe@example.com' })
       .then(deletedStudent => {
           console.log('Deleted student:', deletedStudent);
       })
       .catch(err => {
           console.error('Error deleting student:', err);
       });
   ```

These examples demonstrate basic CRUD operations using Mongoose methods for the `Student` collection in MongoDB. Adjust the code according to your specific use case and requirements.




####################################################### JOIN USE 


Mongoose doesn't support traditional SQL-style joins because MongoDB, the underlying database, is a NoSQL database and does not support joins in the same way as relational databases. However, Mongoose provides a feature called "population" that allows you to reference documents in other collections and "populate" them in queries.

Let's consider an example with two collections: `Student` and `Course`, where each student is enrolled in multiple courses.

First, define the Mongoose schema for both collections:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const studentSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    courses: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Course' }]
});

const courseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    description: String
});

const Student = mongoose.model('Student', studentSchema);
const Course = mongoose.model('Course', courseSchema);

module.exports = { Student, Course };
```

In the `Student` schema, we define a field called `courses` which is an array of `ObjectId` references to documents in the `Course` collection.

Now, let's perform a query to find a student and populate their enrolled courses:

```javascript
const { Student, Course } = require('./models');

// Find a student by ID and populate their courses
Student.findById(studentId)
    .populate('courses')
    .exec((err, student) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Error finding student:', err);
            return;
        }
        console.log('Student:', student);
    });
```

In this example, the `populate('courses')` method tells Mongoose to replace the array of `ObjectId` references in the `courses` field with the actual documents from the `Course` collection. This allows you to retrieve related data from another collection in a single query.

Keep in mind that population in Mongoose is not a traditional SQL join, but it serves a similar purpose by allowing you to fetch related documents from other collections. Adjust the code according to your specific use case and requirements.
