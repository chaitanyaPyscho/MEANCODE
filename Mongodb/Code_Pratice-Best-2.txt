Creating an industry-level codebase for the backend part of a MEAN stack application (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) involves careful organization, adherence to best practices, and a focus on scalability and maintainability. Here's a guide on folder structure, naming conventions, and tips for writing high-quality code:

Folder Structure:
src/: Root directory for source code.
config/: Configuration files (e.g., database configurations, environment variables).
controllers/: Handlers for HTTP requests.
middlewares/: Middleware functions (e.g., authentication, error handling).
models/: Data models representing MongoDB schemas.
routes/: Express route definitions.
services/: Business logic and services.
utils/: Utility functions and helper modules.
tests/: Unit tests.
app.js: Main application file.
server.js: Entry point for the server.
Tips and Guidelines:
Naming Conventions:

Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and files.
Follow camelCase for variable and function names.
Use PascalCase for class names.
Prefix interfaces with 'I' (e.g., IUser).
Avoid abbreviations and acronyms unless they are universally understood.
Modularization:

Break down the codebase into smaller, reusable modules.
Each file or module should have a single responsibility.
Avoid creating monolithic files or functions.
Separation of Concerns:

Keep business logic separate from presentation and data access logic.
Controllers should handle HTTP requests and delegate business logic to services.
Services should encapsulate business logic and interact with models for data access.
Error Handling:

Implement centralized error handling using middleware.
Define custom error classes for different types of errors.
Use try-catch blocks to handle synchronous errors within route handlers.
Middleware:

Use middleware functions for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and error handling.
Organize middleware logically and apply them selectively to routes.
Validation:

Validate request data using libraries like Joi or express-validator.
Implement input validation middleware to ensure data integrity and security.
Logging:

Implement logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.
Use logging libraries like Winston or Morgan to log requests, errors, and application events.
Security:

Implement security best practices such as input validation, authentication, and authorization.
Use packages like helmet to set HTTP headers for enhanced security.
