`ContentChild` is a decorator in Angular used to query and access a single instance of a directive or component within the content of its parent component's template. It allows a parent component to interact with its child components or directives that are projected into its content using Angular's content projection mechanism (`<ng-content>`).

Here's how to use `ContentChild` and an explanation:

1. **Create Child Component:**

   ```typescript
   import { Component } from '@angular/core';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-child',
     template: `
       <div>
         Child Component
       </div>
     `
   })
   export class ChildComponent {
     // Child component logic
   }
   ```

2. **Create Parent Component:**

   ```typescript
   import { Component, ContentChild, AfterContentInit } from '@angular/core';
   import { ChildComponent } from './child.component';

   @Component({
     selector: 'app-parent',
     template: `
       <div>
         <h2>Parent Component</h2>
         <ng-content></ng-content> <!-- This is where child components will be projected -->
       </div>
     `
   })
   export class ParentComponent implements AfterContentInit {
     @ContentChild(ChildComponent) childComponent: ChildComponent;

     ngAfterContentInit() {
       if (this.childComponent) {
         console.log('Child Component found:', this.childComponent);
       } else {
         console.log('Child Component not found');
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Explanation:
   - The `ParentComponent` template includes `<ng-content></ng-content>` to project child components into its content area.
   - The `ContentChild` decorator is used to query the first instance of `ChildComponent` within the content of the `ParentComponent`.
   - In the `ngAfterContentInit` lifecycle hook, we check if a child component instance was found using `ContentChild`. If found, we can interact with it as needed.

3. **App Module:**

   Import and declare both the `ParentComponent` and `ChildComponent` in the AppModule.

4. **Usage in Template:**

   Use the `app-parent` selector in any other component's template where you want to display the parent component and project child components into its content.

   ```html
   <app-parent>
     <app-child></app-child>
   </app-parent>
   ```

5. **Result:**

   When the `ParentComponent` is rendered, it projects the `ChildComponent` into its content area. The `ContentChild` decorator in the `ParentComponent` class captures the instance of the `ChildComponent`, and we can perform any necessary actions or logic with it.

This example demonstrates how to use `ContentChild` to access a child component within the content of a parent component's template. It allows the parent component to interact with and manipulate its child components that are projected into its content area.
