Certainly! Below is a simple example of user login and logout using cookies in an Express.js application, with step-by-step explanations:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Middleware for parsing cookies
app.use(cookieParser());

// Mock user data (replace with database integration in a real application)
const users = [
    { id: 1, username: 'user1', password: 'password1' },
    { id: 2, username: 'user2', password: 'password2' }
];

// Route for user login
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    const { username, password } = req.body;

    // Find user by username and password (mock authentication)
    const user = users.find(user => user.username === username && user.password === password);

    if (user) {
        // Set a cookie to indicate user is logged in
        res.cookie('user_id', user.id, { maxAge: 900000, httpOnly: true });
        res.send('Login successful');
    } else {
        res.status(401).send('Invalid username or password');
    }
});

// Route for user logout
app.post('/logout', (req, res) => {
    // Clear the user_id cookie to indicate user is logged out
    res.clearCookie('user_id');
    res.send('Logout successful');
});

// Route to check if user is logged in
app.get('/check-login', (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.cookies.user_id;

    if (userId) {
        // User is logged in
        res.send('User is logged in');
    } else {
        // User is not logged in
        res.send('User is not logged in');
    }
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Import Modules and Set Up Express App:**
   - We import the necessary modules (`express` and `cookie-parser`) and create an instance of the Express application.

2. **Use Cookie Parser Middleware:**
   - We use the `cookieParser()` middleware to parse cookies from incoming requests automatically.

3. **Mock User Data:**
   - We define a mock array of user objects. In a real application, this data would be retrieved from a database.

4. **User Login Route:**
   - We define a route (`/login`) for user login. When a POST request is made to this route with a username and password, we attempt to find a matching user in the mock user data.
   - If a user is found, we set a cookie named 'user_id' with the user's ID and send a response indicating successful login.
   - If no user is found, we send a 401 Unauthorized status with an error message.

5. **User Logout Route:**
   - We define a route (`/logout`) for user logout. When a POST request is made to this route, we clear the 'user_id' cookie to indicate the user is logged out, and send a response indicating successful logout.

6. **Check Login Route:**
   - We define a route (`/check-login`) to check if a user is logged in. When a GET request is made to this route, we check if the 'user_id' cookie is present.
   - If the cookie exists, we send a response indicating that the user is logged in. If not, we send a response indicating that the user is not logged in.

7. **Start Server:**
   - We start the Express server, which listens for incoming requests on the specified port.

### Summary:

- User login and logout functionality is implemented using cookies to track the user's authentication state.
- Cookies are set upon successful login and cleared upon logout.
- Routes are provided to handle user login, logout, and check the user's authentication status.

This example demonstrates a basic implementation of user login and logout using cookies in an Express.js application. It can be expanded and customized further to suit the requirements of a real-world application.

Certainly! Here's an example of how to implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, save the token in a cookie, and send responses to users in an Express.js application, along with step-by-step explanations:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Secret key for JWT
const secretKey = 'secret';

// Middleware for parsing cookies
app.use(cookieParser());

// Middleware for verifying JWT token
function verifyToken(req, res, next) {
    const token = req.cookies.jwt_token;

    if (!token) {
        return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized: No token provided');
    }

    jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, decoded) => {
        if (err) {
            return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized: Invalid token');
        }
        req.user = decoded;
        next();
    });
}

// Route for user login
app.post('/login', (req, res) => {
    // Mock user data (replace with database integration in a real application)
    const user = { id: 1, username: 'user1' };

    // Create JWT token
    const token = jwt.sign(user, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });

    // Set token in a cookie
    res.cookie('jwt_token', token, { httpOnly: true });
    res.send('Login successful');
});

// Protected route accessible only with a valid JWT token
app.get('/protected', verifyToken, (req, res) => {
    res.send(`Welcome, ${req.user.username}!`);
});

// Route for user logout
app.post('/logout', (req, res) => {
    // Clear JWT token cookie
    res.clearCookie('jwt_token');
    res.send('Logout successful');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Import Modules and Set Up Express App:**
   - We import the necessary modules (`express`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `cookie-parser`) and create an instance of the Express application.

2. **Define Secret Key for JWT:**
   - We define a secret key used to sign and verify JWT tokens.

3. **Use Cookie Parser Middleware:**
   - We use the `cookieParser()` middleware to parse cookies from incoming requests automatically.

4. **Middleware for Verifying JWT Token:**
   - We define a middleware function (`verifyToken`) to verify the JWT token sent in the request cookies.
   - If a valid token is present, the decoded user information is attached to the request object (`req.user`), and the next middleware in the chain is called.
   - If the token is missing or invalid, a 401 Unauthorized response is sent back.

5. **User Login Route:**
   - We define a route (`/login`) for user login. Upon successful authentication (mocked in this example), a JWT token is created using `jwt.sign()` with the user information and the secret key.
   - The generated token is then set in a cookie named 'jwt_token' using `res.cookie()`, with the `httpOnly` option set to true for security.

6. **Protected Route with JWT Verification:**
   - We define a route (`/protected`) that is accessible only with a valid JWT token. The `verifyToken` middleware is used to verify the token before allowing access to the route.
   - If the token is valid, the route sends a welcome message to the authenticated user.

7. **User Logout Route:**
   - We define a route (`/logout`) for user logout. When a POST request is made to this route, the 'jwt_token' cookie is cleared using `res.clearCookie()`, effectively logging the user out.

8. **Start Server:**
   - We start the Express server, which listens for incoming requests on the specified port.

### Summary:

- JWT tokens are used for authentication, providing a secure and stateless way to authenticate users.
- The JWT token is stored in a cookie with the `httpOnly` option set to true for added security.
- Middleware is used to verify the JWT token before granting access to protected routes.
- User login/logout functionality is implemented, allowing users to authenticate and access protected resources securely.

This example demonstrates a basic implementation of using JWT tokens for authentication, storing the token in a cookie, and handling user login/logout in an Express.js application. It can be extended and customized further to meet the specific requirements of your application.
