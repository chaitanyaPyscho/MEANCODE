Implementing caching in an Express.js application can improve performance by reducing the response time for frequently accessed data. Below is a basic example demonstrating client-side caching and server-side caching using Redis:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const redis = require('redis');
const responseTime = require('response-time');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Client-side caching (using response headers)
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    res.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=300'); // Cache response for 5 minutes
    next();
});

// Server-side caching with Redis middleware
const client = redis.createClient();

// Middleware for response time tracking
app.use(responseTime());

// Middleware for server-side caching with Redis
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const key = req.url;

    client.get(key, (err, cachedData) => {
        if (err) throw err;

        if (cachedData) {
            console.log('Cache Hit');
            res.send(cachedData);
        } else {
            console.log('Cache Miss');
            res.sendResponse = res.send;
            res.send = (body) => {
                client.setex(key, 300, body); // Cache response for 5 minutes
                res.sendResponse(body);
            };
            next();
        }
    });
});

// Route for fetching data
app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
    // Simulating data fetching from a database
    const data = { message: 'This is some data' };
    res.json(data);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Explanation:

1. **Set Up Express App:**
   - We create an instance of the Express application and define the port number.

2. **Client-side Caching Middleware:**
   - We use middleware to set cache-related response headers (`Cache-Control`) instructing clients to cache responses for a specified duration.

3. **Server-side Caching with Redis Middleware:**
   - We create a Redis client using `redis.createClient()` to connect to a Redis server.
   - We use the `response-time` middleware to track response times for requests.
   - We define middleware to handle server-side caching with Redis. It checks if the requested data exists in the cache (Redis) by using the request URL as the cache key.
   - If the data is found in the cache (cache hit), it sends the cached data as the response.
   - If the data is not found in the cache (cache miss), it continues to the next middleware to fetch the data and cache it before sending the response.

4. **Route for Fetching Data:**
   - We define a route (`/data`) for fetching data. In a real application, this route would typically fetch data from a database.
   - For demonstration purposes, we simulate fetching data by sending a JSON response with some dummy data.

### Summary:

- Client-side caching is implemented by setting cache-related response headers (`Cache-Control`) to instruct clients to cache responses.
- Server-side caching is implemented using Redis as a caching layer. Responses are cached in Redis, and subsequent requests for the same data are served from the cache if available.
- Middleware functions are used to integrate caching mechanisms into the request-response cycle, providing both client-side and server-side caching benefits.

This basic example demonstrates how to implement client-side and server-side caching in an Express.js application using response headers and Redis middleware. Caching can significantly improve application performance by reducing response times and server load for frequently accessed data.
