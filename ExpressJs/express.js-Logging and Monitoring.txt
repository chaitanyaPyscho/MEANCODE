Logging and monitoring are essential components of any production-grade application, providing insights into application behavior, performance, and potential issues. Let's explore some concepts and a basic code example for logging and monitoring in an Express.js application:

### Concept:

1. **Logging:**
   - Logging involves capturing and recording events, errors, and other relevant information during the execution of an application.
   - Logs provide visibility into the application's behavior, facilitate troubleshooting, and help in identifying performance bottlenecks and security incidents.
   - Common logging levels include INFO, DEBUG, WARN, and ERROR, each indicating the severity of the logged event.

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Monitoring involves actively observing and tracking various metrics and indicators to assess the health, performance, and availability of an application.
   - Monitoring solutions collect and analyze data such as response times, error rates, resource utilization, and system health to ensure optimal operation and identify anomalies or issues.

### Code Example:

Below is a basic example demonstrating logging and monitoring setup in an Express.js application using popular libraries like `morgan` for request logging and `express-prom-bundle` for Prometheus-based monitoring:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const promBundle = require('express-prom-bundle');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Logging middleware using Morgan
app.use(morgan('combined'));

// Monitoring middleware using express-prom-bundle (Prometheus metrics)
const metricsMiddleware = promBundle({ includeMethod: true });
app.use(metricsMiddleware);

// Route for handling requests
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, world!');
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

### Explanation:

1. **Set Up Express App:**
   - We create an instance of the Express application and define the port number.

2. **Logging Middleware (Morgan):**
   - We use the `morgan` middleware to log HTTP requests to the console. The `'combined'` format includes standard Apache combined log output.

3. **Monitoring Middleware (express-prom-bundle):**
   - We use the `express-prom-bundle` middleware to collect Prometheus-compatible metrics from the application.
   - The `includeMethod: true` option includes HTTP method labels in the metrics, providing additional granularity.

4. **Route for Handling Requests:**
   - We define a simple route (`/`) to handle incoming HTTP requests. In a real application, this route would contain more complex logic.

5. **Start the Server:**
   - We start the Express.js server, which listens on the specified port.

### Summary:

- Logging and monitoring are critical components of a production-grade application, providing visibility into application behavior and performance.
- Libraries like `morgan` and `express-prom-bundle` simplify the setup of logging and monitoring in Express.js applications.
- Request logging helps track incoming requests and diagnose issues, while monitoring provides insights into application metrics and performance.

This basic example demonstrates how to set up logging and monitoring in an Express.js application using `morgan` for request logging and `express-prom-bundle` for Prometheus-based monitoring. Depending on your specific requirements and infrastructure, you may choose different logging and monitoring solutions and customize their configurations accordingly.
